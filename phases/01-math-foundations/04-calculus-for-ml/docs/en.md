# Calculus for Machine Learning

> Derivatives tell you which way is downhill. That is all a neural network needs to learn.

**Type:** Learn
**Language:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1, Lessons 01-03
**Time:** ~60 minutes

## The Problem

You have a neural network with millions of weights. Each weight is a knob. You need to figure out which direction to turn every single knob to make the model slightly less wrong. Calculus gives you that direction.

Without calculus, training a neural network would mean trying random changes and hoping for the best. With derivatives, you know exactly how each weight affects the error. You turn every knob the right way, every time.

## The Concept

### What is a derivative?

A derivative measures the rate of change. For a function y = f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells you: if you nudge x by a tiny amount, how much does y change?

Geometrically, the derivative is the slope of the tangent line at a point.

**f(x) = x^2:**

| x | f(x) | f'(x) (slope) |
|---|------|---------------|
| 0 | 0    | 0 (flat, at the bottom) |
| 1 | 1    | 2 |
| 2 | 4    | 4 (tangent line slope at this point) |
| 3 | 9    | 6 |

At x=2, the slope is 4. If you move x a tiny bit to the right, y increases by about 4 times that amount. At x=0, the slope is 0. You are at the bottom of the bowl.

The formal definition:

```
f'(x) = lim   f(x + h) - f(x)
        h->0  -----------------
                     h
```

In code, you skip the limit and just use a very small h. That is the numerical derivative.

### Partial derivatives: one variable at a time

Real functions have many inputs. A neural network loss depends on thousands of weights. A partial derivative holds all variables constant except one, then takes the derivative with respect to that one.

```
f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2

df/dx = 2x + 3y     (treat y as a constant)
df/dy = 3x + 2y     (treat x as a constant)
```

Each partial derivative answers: if I nudge just this one weight, how does the loss change?

### The gradient: vector of all partial derivatives

The gradient collects every partial derivative into one vector. For a function f(x, y, z), the gradient is:

```
grad f = [ df/dx, df/dy, df/dz ]
```

The gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent. To minimize a function, go in the opposite direction.

**Contour plot of f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2:**

The function forms a bowl shape with concentric circles as contour lines. The minimum is at (0, 0).

| Point | grad f | -grad f (descent direction) |
|-------|--------|----------------------------|
| (1, 1) | [2, 2] (points uphill, away from minimum) | [-2, -2] (points downhill, toward minimum) |
| (0, 0) | [0, 0] (flat, at the minimum) | [0, 0] |

This is gradient descent in a picture. Compute the gradient, negate it, take a step.

### The connection to optimization

Training a neural network is optimization. You have a loss function L(w1, w2, ..., wn) that measures how wrong the model is. You want to minimize it.

```
Gradient descent update rule:

  w_new = w_old - learning_rate * dL/dw

For every weight:
  1. Compute the partial derivative of loss with respect to that weight
  2. Subtract a small multiple of it from the weight
  3. Repeat
```

The learning rate controls step size. Too big and you overshoot. Too small and you crawl.

**Loss landscape (1D slice):**

The loss function L(w) forms a curve with peaks and valleys as the weight w varies.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Global minimum | The lowest point on the entire curve -- the best solution |
| Local minimum | A valley that is lower than its neighbors but not the lowest overall |
| Slope | Gradient descent follows the slope downhill from any starting point |

Gradient descent follows the slope downhill. It can get stuck in local minima, but in high-dimensional spaces (millions of weights) this is rarely a practical problem.

### Numerical vs analytical derivatives

There are two ways to compute a derivative.

Analytical: apply calculus rules by hand. For f(x) = x^2, the derivative is f'(x) = 2x. Exact. Fast.

Numerical: approximate using the definition. Compute f(x+h) and f(x-h) for a tiny h, then use the difference.

```
Numerical (central difference):

f'(x) ~= f(x + h) - f(x - h)
          -----------------------
                  2h

h = 0.0001 works well in practice
```

Numerical derivatives are slower but work for any function. Analytical derivatives are fast but require you to derive the formula. Neural network frameworks use a third approach: automatic differentiation, which computes exact derivatives mechanically. You will see that in Phase 3.

### Derivatives by hand for simple functions

These are the derivatives you will see over and over in ML.

```
Function        Derivative       Used in
--------        ----------       -------
f(x) = x^2     f'(x) = 2x      Loss functions (MSE)
f(x) = wx + b  f'(w) = x        Linear layer (gradient w.r.t. weight)
                f'(b) = 1        Linear layer (gradient w.r.t. bias)
                f'(x) = w        Linear layer (gradient w.r.t. input)
f(x) = e^x     f'(x) = e^x     Softmax, attention
f(x) = ln(x)   f'(x) = 1/x     Cross-entropy loss
f(x) = 1/(1+e^-x)  f'(x) = f(x)(1-f(x))   Sigmoid activation
```

For f(x) = x^2:

```
f(x) = x^2    f'(x) = 2x

  x    f(x)   f'(x)   meaning
  -2    4      -4      slope tilts left (decreasing)
  -1    1      -2      slope tilts left (decreasing)
   0    0       0      flat (minimum!)
   1    1       2      slope tilts right (increasing)
   2    4       4      slope tilts right (increasing)
```

For f(w) = wx + b with x=3, b=1:

```
f(w) = 3w + 1    f'(w) = 3

The derivative with respect to w is just x.
If x is big, a small change in w causes a big change in output.
```

### The chain rule

When functions are composed, the chain rule tells you how to differentiate.

```
If y = f(g(x)), then dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

Example: y = (3x + 1)^2
  outer: f(u) = u^2       f'(u) = 2u
  inner: g(x) = 3x + 1    g'(x) = 3
  dy/dx = 2(3x + 1) * 3 = 6(3x + 1)
```

Neural networks are chains of functions: input -> linear -> activation -> linear -> activation -> loss. Backpropagation is the chain rule applied repeatedly from output to input. That is the entire algorithm.

### The Jacobian matrix

When a function maps a vector to a vector (like a neural network layer), its derivative is a matrix. The Jacobian contains every partial derivative of every output with respect to every input.

For f: R^n -> R^m, the Jacobian J is an m x n matrix:

| | x1 | x2 | ... | xn |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| f1 | df1/dx1 | df1/dx2 | ... | df1/dxn |
| f2 | df2/dx1 | df2/dx2 | ... | df2/dxn |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| fm | dfm/dx1 | dfm/dx2 | ... | dfm/dxn |

You will not compute Jacobians by hand for neural networks. PyTorch handles it. But knowing it exists helps you understand shapes in backpropagation: if a layer maps R^n to R^m, its Jacobian is m x n. The gradient flows backward through the transpose of this matrix.

### Why this matters for neural networks

Every weight in a neural network gets a gradient. The gradient tells you how to adjust that weight to reduce the loss.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Forward["Forward Pass"]
        I["input"] --> W1["W1"] --> R["relu"] --> W2["W2"] --> S["softmax"] --> L["loss"]
    end
```

```mermaid
graph RL
    subgraph Backward["Backward Pass"]
        dL["dL/dloss"] --> dW2["dL/dW2"] --> d2["..."] --> dW1["dL/dW1"]
    end
```

Each weight update:
- `W1 = W1 - lr * dL/dW1`
- `W2 = W2 - lr * dL/dW2`

The forward pass computes the prediction and loss. The backward pass computes the gradient of the loss with respect to every weight. Then every weight takes a small step downhill. Repeat for millions of steps. That is deep learning.

## Build It

### Step 1: Numerical derivative from scratch

```python
def numerical_derivative(f, x, h=1e-7):
    return (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2 * h)

def f(x):
    return x ** 2

for x in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    numerical = numerical_derivative(f, x)
    analytical = 2 * x
    print(f"x={x:2d}  f'(x) numerical={numerical:.6f}  analytical={analytical:.1f}")
```

The numerical derivative matches the analytical one to many decimal places.

### Step 2: Partial derivatives and gradients

```python
def numerical_gradient(f, point, h=1e-7):
    gradient = []
    for i in range(len(point)):
        point_plus = list(point)
        point_minus = list(point)
        point_plus[i] += h
        point_minus[i] -= h
        partial = (f(point_plus) - f(point_minus)) / (2 * h)
        gradient.append(partial)
    return gradient

def f_multi(point):
    x, y = point
    return x**2 + 3*x*y + y**2

grad = numerical_gradient(f_multi, [1.0, 2.0])
print(f"Numerical gradient at (1,2): {[f'{g:.4f}' for g in grad]}")
print(f"Analytical gradient at (1,2): [2*1+3*2, 3*1+2*2] = [{2*1+3*2}, {3*1+2*2}]")
```

### Step 3: Gradient descent to find the minimum of f(x) = x^2

```python
x = 5.0
lr = 0.1
for step in range(20):
    grad = 2 * x
    x = x - lr * grad
    print(f"step {step:2d}  x={x:8.4f}  f(x)={x**2:10.6f}")
```

Starting at x=5, each step moves closer to x=0 (the minimum).

### Step 4: Gradient descent on a 2D function

```python
def f_2d(point):
    x, y = point
    return x**2 + y**2

point = [4.0, 3.0]
lr = 0.1
for step in range(30):
    grad = numerical_gradient(f_2d, point)
    point = [p - lr * g for p, g in zip(point, grad)]
    loss = f_2d(point)
    if step % 5 == 0 or step == 29:
        print(f"step {step:2d}  point=({point[0]:7.4f}, {point[1]:7.4f})  f={loss:.6f}")
```

### Step 5: Comparing numerical and analytical derivatives

```python
import math

test_functions = [
    ("x^2",      lambda x: x**2,          lambda x: 2*x),
    ("x^3",      lambda x: x**3,          lambda x: 3*x**2),
    ("sin(x)",   lambda x: math.sin(x),   lambda x: math.cos(x)),
    ("e^x",      lambda x: math.exp(x),   lambda x: math.exp(x)),
    ("1/x",      lambda x: 1/x,           lambda x: -1/x**2),
]

x = 2.0
print(f"{'Function':<12} {'Numerical':>12} {'Analytical':>12} {'Error':>12}")
print("-" * 50)
for name, f, df in test_functions:
    num = numerical_derivative(f, x)
    ana = df(x)
    err = abs(num - ana)
    print(f"{name:<12} {num:12.6f} {ana:12.6f} {err:12.2e}")
```

### Step 6: Why this matters for a neural network

```python
import random

random.seed(42)

w = random.gauss(0, 1)
b = random.gauss(0, 1)
lr = 0.01

xs = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
ys = [3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, 11.0]

for epoch in range(200):
    total_loss = 0
    dw = 0
    db = 0
    for x, y in zip(xs, ys):
        pred = w * x + b
        error = pred - y
        total_loss += error ** 2
        dw += 2 * error * x
        db += 2 * error
    dw /= len(xs)
    db /= len(xs)
    total_loss /= len(xs)
    w -= lr * dw
    b -= lr * db
    if epoch % 40 == 0 or epoch == 199:
        print(f"epoch {epoch:3d}  w={w:.4f}  b={b:.4f}  loss={total_loss:.6f}")

print(f"\nLearned: y = {w:.2f}x + {b:.2f}")
print(f"Actual:  y = 2x + 1")
```

Every gradient-based training loop follows this pattern: predict, compute loss, compute gradients, update weights.

## Use It

With NumPy, the same operations are faster and more concise:

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=float)
y = np.array([3, 5, 7, 9, 11], dtype=float)

w, b = np.random.randn(), np.random.randn()
lr = 0.01

for epoch in range(200):
    pred = w * x + b
    error = pred - y
    loss = np.mean(error ** 2)
    dw = np.mean(2 * error * x)
    db = np.mean(2 * error)
    w -= lr * dw
    b -= lr * db

print(f"Learned: y = {w:.2f}x + {b:.2f}")
```

You just built gradient descent from scratch. PyTorch automates the gradient computation, but the update loop is identical.

## Exercises

1. Implement `numerical_second_derivative(f, x)` using `numerical_derivative` called twice. Verify that the second derivative of x^3 at x=2 is 12.
2. Use gradient descent to find the minimum of f(x, y) = (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2. Start from (0, 0). The answer should converge to (3, -1).
3. Add momentum to the gradient descent loop: maintain a velocity vector that accumulates past gradients. Compare convergence speed with and without momentum on f(x) = x^4 - 3x^2.
